# Dockerize All The Things
Make your life easier by using containers for everything. This repo will walk through adding docker to your workflow and reducing the need to ever install deps ( Gems, Node Modules, etc ) on your system but instead rely on Docker for all of that. 

## Intro
You know what is awful? Picking up a project that is using outdated versions that differ from your system. We have tools for that ( rbenv, RVM, NVM ) which help with this but you can still run into weird issues where even still things just don't work and you wind up spinning your wheels trying to get things to install and running before you can even start dev.

The purpose of this project is to show how radical using containers is and how you can avoid ever having to install dependencies on your system beyond the core essentials for scaffolding apps.

Using containers in this manner means teams can get spun up on projects faster and start contributing to the code.

## Tools
In order to run these code examples you will need the folllowing:
- Docker
	- [OSX](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/)
	- [Windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/)
	- [Ubuntu](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/)

That's it!
